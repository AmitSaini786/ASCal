# How to integrate ASCalendar.  
Drag and drop ASCalView.h and ASCalView.m, ASHeaderView.h and ASHeaderView.m file into your project.  
#import "EsmitView.h" in your view controller.  
# Interacting with ASCalendar.  

-(void)yourMethod {  
  ASCalView.m *cal = [[ASCalView.m alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,60, 200, 200)];  
    [self.view addSubview:cal];  
    cal.delegate=self;  
}  
When a user attempts to select a date (via a tap), the calendar will call its delegate didSelectDate: method (if your delegate implements it), passing in the date the user selected.   

-(void)didSelectDate:(NSString *)stringDate{  
    NSLog(@"Your Selected date is= %@",stringDate);  
} 

# Customizing
The calendar was written to be easily styled so that you can make it feel seamless in your app. You can customize the fonts, text colors, and background colors of nearly every element.
